Hello! I'm Matt! While I made this website predominantly to show off my professional skills and reflect on my past projects, I thought it would be a missed opportunity to just leave it at that. So, this section of my site is just a small, self-indulgent display of myself, especially outside of industry.

  <template #body>

I was born and raised in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. While my lifestyle has shifted to fit an environment much more fast-paced than a Denver suburb, I really love Colorado, and I always miss being able to look up at the mountains to find out what direction west is. 

Now, I attend the Georgia Institute of Technology as a computer science major, and at the time of writing, I'm entering my final year at Tech. I also really love Georgia Tech -- not only did the CS program and BoG drive my passion for the subject, I've met and done a lot of cool things here.

A section about post-graduation goes here, but
